# Original Project Configuration Step Undertaken

The outline of the client-tier of the project, using Vue.js, was originally created by running the command `vue create client-tier`. The resulting Vue.js generated _skeleton_ files were then modified to enable displaying and navigating books data using the Python REST APIs from the app-tier. When `vue create` was originally run, the following answers were provided in response to the tool's prompts (__DO NOT__ run this again as this will overwrite the modified files - this is just provided for informational purposes)
 - Choose _Babel_ + _Router_ + _Linter/Formatter_
 - Use _history mode_ for router
 - Use _Airbnb_ Linter / formatter
 - Select to _Lint on save_
 - Place config in _package.json_
 - Don't select to _save as preset for future projects_
